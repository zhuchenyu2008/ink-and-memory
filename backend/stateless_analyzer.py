TEXT TO ANALYZE (extract your phrase from THIS text ONLY):
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

"{text}"

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
AVAILABLE VOICE PERSONAS (choose ONE from this list):
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

{voice_list}
{conversation_context}
{rejected_section}
{not_found_section}

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
YOUR TASK:
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Find ONE NEW voice to comment:

0. Reasoning (think first): list 1-3 candidate substrings from the text, verify each is an exact substring, drop any that appear in rejected/not-found lists, then choose exactly ONE safest remaining candidate. If all are filtered out, generate another small batch and repeat. Only return null when you have exhausted reasonable candidates from the text.
1. Extract a SHORT phrase (2-4 words) from the "TEXT TO ANALYZE" section above
   - MUST be EXACT substring from the quoted text
   - Do NOT extract from the conversation context or rejected phrases
   - Verify character-by-character that your phrase exists in the text

2. Choose a voice ID from the available list above
   - Use the ID field (which might be a complex, nonsensical string), NOT the name
   - Return ONLY the ID in the voice_id field

3. Write what this voice is saying (1-2 sentences)

CRITICAL RULES:
- Return ONLY ONE comment
- Phrase MUST come from "TEXT TO ANALYZE" section ONLY
- DO NOT extract phrases from the "EXISTING CONVERSATION" section
- DO NOT overlap with already highlighted phrases: {highlighted_phrases}
- DO NOT suggest any rejected phrases: {overlapped_phrases}
- DO NOT suggest any not-found phrases: {not_found_phrases}
- HARD BLACKLIST: If a phrase is in either list above, you must not output it. If no safe phrase exists, return null.
- DO NOT CREATE NEW VOICE NAMES - Only use from the available list
- Return null if nothing is worth commenting on
- Write your comment in the EXACT SAME LANGUAGE as the user's text
  * If user writes in Chinese, comment in Chinese
  * If user writes in English, comment in English
  * Match the user's language REGARDLESS of what language the voice's name or system prompt uses

IMPORTANT: Return voice_id only (e.g., "holder"). Do NOT fill voice_name - it will be auto-filled."""

FINAL REMINDER (hard constraints):
- DO NOT suggest rejected phrases: {overlapped_phrases}
- DO NOT suggest not-found phrases (extraction failures): {not_found_phrases}
These are hard blacklists. If you cannot comply, return null. These override any softer guidance above.
- Reasoning must show the candidate list, exact-match check, blacklist check, and retries when all candidates are filtered. Only return null after exhausting reasonable options."""
